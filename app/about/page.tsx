      About Haven & Hue
At Haven & Hue, we believe that luxury lives in the details—an elegant curve of a marble table, the soft glow of a handcrafted lamp, or the quiet comfort of a beautifully made bed. Our mission is to offer timeless, design-forward pieces that elevate your home into a curated sanctuary—where sophistication meets soul.

Each item in our collection is hand-selected for its craftsmanship, material integrity, and enduring style. From statement lighting to heirloom-quality furniture and refined textiles, we blend classic elegance with modern sensibilities. We don’t follow fleeting trends—instead, we craft a space where quality, comfort, and design stand the test of time.

<h2 className="flex flex-wrap gap-2 sm:gap-x-6 items-center justify-center text-3xl font-bold leading-none tracking-wide sm:text-6xl">Our Story</h2> 
<p className='mt-6 text-lg tracking-wide leading-8 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-muted-foreground'>Haven & Hue was founded by Pawel Kozubal, an interior design enthusiast with a passion for meaningful living. After years of traveling and sourcing unique décor from around the world, he envisioned a space where luxury wasn’t just about price—it was about purpose, feeling, and presence.

What began as a personal collection of beautifully crafted home pieces has grown into a destination for those who value elevated living. From the beginning, Pawel believed that the home is more than a backdrop—it’s a reflection of your life, your values, and your vision.

Today, Haven & Hue continues that journey—inviting you to slow down, choose with intention, and design a home that speaks quietly, yet beautifully, of who you are.</p>
